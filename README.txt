This is a incredibly simple yet somewhat useful plugin for KSP, allowing you to give a part a "tag" in a config file.

That's all it does if im honest.

I developed this for a simple way to set configs for vessels that are generally the same (such as Falcons ect ect) to allow users to potentially use this to interface with other things


A few examples can be found in the examples folder
